# CS39440
Major Project on Turn Me Into a Sprite by Evan Rees

To run this application run the two lines:
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app/main.py

This technical work contains both the back end and the front end for the project. backend.py handles the video and image processing as well as any debugging to do with the pose detection and image processing. frontend.py handles the user interface and the inputs for the back end. main.py allows the two to interact.
